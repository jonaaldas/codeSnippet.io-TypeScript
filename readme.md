# Code Snippet
When I was learning how to code one of the biggest problems I had was remembering the syntax I just learned. At the time I was storing the syntax in my notes app. I noticed there were a couple of problems with this approach. The code snippets were not searchable. The code snippets were not formatted correctly, and I was storing the code and my notes app and I have other stuff there that gets in the way of finding what I need.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Babel, 

When I was thinking, I had to solve this problem. The first thing I did was go to Google and find an app that will allow me to do this. Then I thought I am learning how to code at the time I knew HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I decided to build the app from scratch using the knowledge I knew back then, I got the app to work how I want it, however, the code was very messy.

This app is a result of trial and error. Trying to find a way to make my vision come true. After searching  on the web I found a framework that allows me to format the code and make a look nice. Fast-forward a couple of months right now I am learning typeScript and I decided the best way to learn is to build something, so I decided to migrate my vanilla JS app to Typescript, and this is the result.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Make the codeSnippets Searchable Add a log-in functionality Add Backend functionality and a database

## Lessons Learned:

This app taught me how to manipulate the DOM and how to work with TypeScript. It showed me the power that typeScript has and how it can prevent bugs in a larger-scale project.
